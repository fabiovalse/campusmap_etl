# Transform

## make_json.py

This script transforms the JSON data generated by the institute scrapers to a new JSON with a specific structure shown below:
```
{
  "id": "<institute_name>",
  "nodes": [...],
  "links: [...],
  "annotations": [...]
}
```

In order to run the script a JSON must be passed through the STDIN and the name of the institute as parameter:
```
cat data.json | python make_json.py institute_name
```
